Convention used in all Kambi's programs:

Options specifications (printed in response to the --help parameter)
should look like this :
(only long form)
'  --long-option        This option description'
'  --long-option ARGUMENT-NAME'
'                       This option description'
'  --very-long-option-name ARGUMENT'
'                       This option has very very long description'
'                       that must be continued on the next line'
(both forms, short and long, available)
'  -s / --long-option   This option description'
'  -s / --long-option  ARGUMENT-NAME'
'                       This option description'

More formally:
- if option has both short and long forms they are specified using
  '-s / --long-option' (with <space>/<space>),
- all help lines can have at most 75 chars,
- 2 spaces are required before option name,
- option descriptions should always start at the 25th column,
  if you can (and want) you can start option description at the same
  line as option name + arguments specification (but always at 25th column,
  so you can't do this if option name + arguments is too long),
  if not - you have to go to the next line. Each subsequent description line
  must be prefixed with 24 spaces (always spaces, never tabs !).

  For some programs value "25" may be changed to something other
  (if it will produce more readable output). However, 25 is my standard
  (e.g. TCastleWindow.ParseParsHelp uses this value "25" so any program that
  wants to use TCastleWindow.ParseParsHelp should also use this "25" value
  to provide nice readable output).
